            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <p>To use these tools effectively and safely, follow these guidelines: When using a rake, firmly grip it and pull it towards you to gather debris, taking care not to strain your back or develop blisters due to improper gripping or bending. When operating a scythe, stand upright and swing it in a wide arc to cut through vegetation, but be cautious to maintain control to prevent cuts or injuries to your legs and feet. When working with a compost bin, add layers of green and brown materials while turning occasionally for aeration, but be careful when turning to avoid scrapes, cuts, or encounters with insects. While using a shovel, insert the blade into the ground, step on the footrest, and lift or move material, ensuring you use your legs and not your back to prevent straining. For a spade, insert the blade into the soil and push it downward or sideways to dig, avoiding excessive force or awkward postures to prevent back or wrist strain. When using a wheelbarrow, load materials into the tray and push or pull it, being cautious not to overload or navigate uneven terrain to prevent tipping and potential injuries to your back or limbs. When handling a hay fork, insert the tines into the bale, lift, and carry it to the desired location, taking care not to stab yourself or others with the fork's tines due to careless handling or a loss of control while carrying a load.</p>

            <h3>!Potential Injury!</h3>
            <p>Potential injuries can arise when these tools are not used properly. When mishandling a rake, there is a risk of straining your back or developing blisters due to excessive gripping or awkward bending. With a scythe, injuries may occur from improper control, resulting in cuts or injuries to the legs and feet. When working with a compost bin, be cautious when turning the compost pile to avoid scrapes, cuts, or encounters with insects. Using poor lifting techniques or overexertion with a shovel can lead to muscle injuries or back strains. Improper force or maintaining awkward postures while digging with a spade can cause strains in the back or wrists. Overloading a wheelbarrow or navigating uneven terrain may result in tipping and potential injuries to the back or limbs. Handling a hay fork carelessly can lead to self-inflicted or accidental injuries, such as stabs or punctures from the fork's tines, particularly when losing control while carrying a load.</p>
