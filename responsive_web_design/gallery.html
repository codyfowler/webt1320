            <h2>Featured Creatures of War</h2>
            <p>This collection of animal photographs shows animals that support military operations. The first image features a war horse, predictably the steadfast transportation pre-combustion engine. Next, a napalm attached bat that was in planning for use during World War II prior to the ending of the war. A diagram depicting a soviet anti-tank dog is captured in the third photograph, which was (luckily) a failed experiment. The fourth image shows a Thai war elephant, whose used ended in the 19th century. A cable running ferrt is in the fifth photo, allowing wiring to be done in complex and compact aircraft internals. The sixth photo is a locator dolphin, there is currently research being done to replace them in their anti-mine warfare role in the US Navy but nothing promising has been developed yet. The sixth is a colorado potato beetle, used against germany in WW2 to destroy their crops. The final picture is of caged canaries, who were more often for moral support than detection of toxic gases.</p>
